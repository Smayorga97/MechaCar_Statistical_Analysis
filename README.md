### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * Vehicle lenght
  * Ground Clearance
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * No, it is not considered to be zero becuase none of the estimated for all coefficient are not equal to zero
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * This model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protoypes because the Adjusted R-squared reflects that 68.25% of the variation within mpg is explained by the coefficients

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
  * The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, the overall summeary meets the design specifications. However when you look at the individual lots, you can see that Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the requierements but Lot 3 does not.
