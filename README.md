### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * Vehicle lenght
  * Ground Clearance
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * No, it is not considered to be zero becuase none of the estimated for all coefficient are not equal to zero
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * This model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protoypes because the Adjusted R-squared reflects that 68.25% of the variation within mpg is explained by the coefficients
